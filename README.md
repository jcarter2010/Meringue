# Merengue
A Raspberry Pi Text Editor

Keep in mind, this is still in its very early stages and very much a work in progress.

To run the Merengue text editor use the command 'python2 merengue.py' in whichever directory you install Merengue to.

If you want to install it as a package use 'pip install git+https://github.com/jcarter2010/Merengue.git'
I would suggest making a symbolic link to the package if you install it like this so that you can just run it with a 'merengue' command or something like that
